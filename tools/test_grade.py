"""Regression tests for grade.py.

    python3 tools/test_grade.py

Covers the defects the v2 grader was written to fix, so that they cannot come
back quietly:

  1. foundation-as-solver scores ~1.0 on every instance -- which is also an
     end-to-end check that baseline extrapolation agrees with reality.
  2. a wrong answer scores the floor AND still counts towards the geometric
     mean, so failing your weakest instance can never raise your score.
  3. the timeout, the 4 GB cap and the single-thread rule are enforced rather
     than merely written down, and one bad instance does not abort the run.
  4. `--baseline-probe` agrees with `--baseline-full`.

Timing thresholds here are deliberately loose: on a shared machine the dev-tier
instances run for only a few seconds, and a few seconds cannot be timed
tightly.  The tests check that the machinery works, not that the clock is
quiet.
